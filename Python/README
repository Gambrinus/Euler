These are my solutions to Project Euler problems (projecteuler.net). Most of them are not the optimal solutions. I am using this project to teach myself Python, so the code is pretty crappy.

**I encourage you not to look at the code if you are also doing Project Euler.**

Figure the stuff out your own way, it's the best way to learn. But if you are frustrated with a problem and have no alternative way to figure it out, I hope my code helps.
